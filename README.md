## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I have practices how to use css grid-column and grid-row, how to use grid-template-rows.
I have learned that it is a better approach to import fonts by ```<link>``` tag in HTML instead of ```@import``` in CSS.

Example: 

✅️ Use this: ⬇️ 
```
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins&display=swap" rel="stylesheet" />
```
instead of this: ⬇️
```
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins&display=swap');
```
